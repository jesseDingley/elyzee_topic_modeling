# elyzee_topic_modeling

Worked on developing visualization tools for LumenAI's online clustering platform, in order to facilitate clustering interpretation. Applied classic natural language processing techniques to this problem, notably topic modeling. This work was done in the context of a summer internship (2020) at LumenAI.
